Welcome to my VOIS Data Analytics Internship portfolio. This repository contains the work I completed during the internship: hands-on sessions, small and major projects, datasets, visual results, and certificates earned. The notebooks and files here showcase data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning workflows that demonstrate my practical skills for data analytics roles.

---

## Highlights

- 4 hands-on session projects covering attrition analysis, space missions, unicorn analysis, and more.
- A major project: Netflix data analysis (notebook, cleaned dataset, results and presentation).
- A minor project and extra practice files demonstrating domain-specific analyses and charts.
- Certificates from VOIS that document completion of the program modules.

Major project (Netflix)

- `major_project_01/Md_Tarik_Anvar_Source_Code_Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook for the Netflix Data Analysis project (data cleaning, EDA, visualisation)
- `major_project_01/Netflix Dataset.csv` — Raw Netflix dataset used for analysis
- `major_project_01/Netflix_Dataset_Cleaned.csv` — Cleaned dataset produced during the project
- `major_project_01/Md_Tarik_Anvar_Netflix Data Analysis Project PPT.pptx` — Presentation summarizing the findings
- `major_project_01/result_01.png` ... `result_10.png` — Key visual outputs and charts from the notebook

Minor & practice projects

- `minor_project_01/01_result.png` ... `minor_project_01/10_result.png` — Visuals and outputs from the minor project

Session folders

- `session_01/Attrition_Analysis.ipynb` — Employee attrition analysis using the `Attrition_Analytics.csv` dataset
- `session_02/firsthandson/ai_job_dataset.csv` — Dataset and charts for AI job data practice
- `session_02/secondhandson/Crop Production Analysis_Narendra.ipynb` — Crop production/recommendation analysis with `Crop_recommendation.csv`
- `session_03/Space_demo.ipynb` — Space missions demo using `space_missions.csv`
- `session_04/unicorns_data_analysis.ipynb` — Analysis of unicorn companies using `Unicorn_Companies.csv`

If you'd like to explore the files, open the linked file paths in your Jupyter environment or view them on GitHub.

## What you'll find in the notebooks

- Data loading and cleaning (handling missing values, filtering, basic transformations)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (summary statistics, grouping, pivot tables)
- Visualizations (matplotlib / seaborn plots exported as PNGs included in the repo)
- Short model experiments where applicable (feature selection, simple predictive models)

These notebooks are written to be readable and reproducible — look for explanatory text cells that describe each step.

---

## Quick start — open and run notebooks (PowerShell)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment, install essentials, then open Jupyter Notebook:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
jupyter notebook
```

2. In the opened browser UI, navigate into the folder (for example `major_project_01`) and open the notebook file (e.g., `Md_Tarik_Anvar_Source_Code_Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb`).

Notes:
- If you prefer JupyterLab, replace `jupyter notebook` with `jupyter lab` after installing `jupyterlab`.
- The notebooks reference standard libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). If you see any extra imports when running, pip-install them as needed.

## Skills & tools demonstrated

- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, deduplication, type conversions
- EDA & visualization: distribution plots, bar charts, heatmaps, group-by summaries
- Basic ML experiments (where applicable): scikit-learn for simple models
- Reproducible notebooks and slide-style presentation for findings

---

## Datasets

The repository includes the datasets used in each analysis. Example datasets:

- `major_project_01/Netflix Dataset.csv` and `Netflix_Dataset_Cleaned.csv`
- `session_01/Attrition_Analytics.csv`
- `session_02/firsthandson/ai_job_dataset.csv`
- `session_02/secondhandson/Crop_recommendation.csv`
- `session_03/space_missions.csv`
- `session_04/Unicorn_Companies.csv`

When sharing or reusing datasets, confirm any licensing or privacy constraints before publishing or distributing outside this portfolio.

## Certificates

The VOIS certificates I earned during the internship are included in this repository. Click each numbered link below to view the certificate (they open in GitHub's PDF viewer):

1. [01 — Basics of Python](01VOIS_Certificate_Basics_of_Python.pdf)
2. [02 — Data Visualization](02VOIS_Certificate_Data_Visualization.pdf)
3. [03 — Data Analysis Using NumPy](03VOIS_Certificate_Data_Analysis_Using_Numpy.pdf)
4. [04 — Data Analysis Using Pandas](04VOIS_Certificate_Data_Analysis_Using_Pandas.pdf)

If you'd like these displayed as images or thumbnails inside the README, I can generate small PNG previews and embed them here — tell me if you want that and I'll add them.

## Tips for reviewers (what to look for)

- In the Netflix project, review the `Md_Tarik_Anvar_Source_Code_Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook for the full analysis flow: cleaning -> EDA -> insights -> plots. The `Netflix_Dataset_Cleaned.csv` is the cleaned version used for visualizations.
- Inspect the PNG results in `major_project_01/` for quick visual evidence of the analysis outputs.
- See `session_01/Attrition_Analysis.ipynb` for a compact example of a business-focused analytics notebook with actionable takeaways.

## Contact & next steps

If you'd like a walk-through, polished report, or a tailored resume-ready extract of these projects, get in touch and I can prepare one. I can also convert key notebooks into HTML reports or GitHub Pages presentations.

Thank you for reviewing my VOIS internship work. I hope these projects demonstrate practical data analytics skills and a readiness to contribute in an analytics role.
